Changes from the [PASTRAISER](http://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html) version
=================================================================================================

Errors in the provided tables
-----------------------------
* The old way of reffering to opcode `$E9` as `JP (HL)` is confusing and has been changed to `JP HL`.
* `STOP` is a single byte in size, older documents encode it as `$10 $00`.
* `$E2` and `$F2` are a single byte in size, not two.

New features
------------
* Different color schemes
* Octal view of the tables
* Responsive design, enjoy reading large tables on your tiny mobile phone!

Misc
----
* Fixed some typos
* Updated the given descriptions
